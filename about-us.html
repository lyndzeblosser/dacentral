						<h5>Electronically Stored Data</h5>
						<p>Knowing how widely disseminated our data has become is frightening enough, but add to that the data that computers create in the background during use and it becomes apparent that controlling access to our data has become nearly impossible.</p>

						<h5>Basics of Access Control Badging</h5>
						<p>A driver's license can't propel a car safely. But when you put a trained, law-abiding driver behind the wheel...there it goes. Think of ID badging the same way; by itself, a photo ID won't secure your building. Add personnel and processes and you have a system which can help protect your product and employees.</p>

						<h5>Video Analytics Today</h5>
						<p>Industry researchers, product and system developers, integrators, and end-users have come together to assess the current state of the video analytics industry. What is to be seen is an industry niche that is maturing, but is still somewhat in its infancy.  Integrators, product vendors and end-users are being forced to be much more realistic about how quickly the technology – which can do things such as identify an intruder and track their movements or recognize abandoned objects.</p>
