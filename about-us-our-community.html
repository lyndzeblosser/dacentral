						<h5>Life Challenge of Southeastern Michigan</h5>
						<p>	We are soliciting donations or gifts from area businesses to help generate funds. If your business is interested in partnering with us for our upcoming 2009 community service project, we would greatly appreciate your input. Your participation will be acknowledged at the events, on our new website, in security trade magazines and articles that we submit to local newspapers as human interest events.</p>

						<p>Life Challenge of Southeastern Michigan is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) ecclesiastical corporation governed by a Board of Directors.  Support comes through individuals, churches, and businesses who believe in helping restore people's lives and getting them back on the right track. LCSM receives no federal, state, or local funding.</p>

						<p>Formerly known as Detroit Teen Challenge, LCSM opened its doors in 1965. LCSM is an affiliate ministry of Teen Challenge International, USA which has over 400 centers world-wide. LCSM is a one year Christian-growth program providing residential care for men and women with alcohol, drug, and other life controlling problems. This program reaches out to people 18 years of age and up from all walks of life. Currently there are approximately 50 students in residence. Some come from the streets, others from well established homes. Some are directed through the court system, others have never had a problem with the law. Some are married, others are single.</p>

						<p>In spite of the many differences, one common denominator exists â€” each person enrolled has come to acknowledge his or her need for help.  With your partnership, we can support LCSM in providing these persons the opportunity to grow into productive, healthy members of society in a one year program of care, discipleship and study. Are the results 100%? No, but they are well over 60%, which is higher than most and high enough to make it very worthwhile.</p>

						<p>Proceeds received from raffle of your donation will be used solely for the benefit of LCSM. D/A Central, Inc is serving as a conduit for LCSM and derives no financial benefit from this activity. Our project goal is simply to generate funds to help support LCSM programs for the residents of LCSM. If you have any questions, you may contact the project group chairman, Laura Perlmutter, at D/A Central, Inc. at 248-399-0600 ext 112, or email: <a href="mailto:laura.perlmutter@dacentral.com">Laura Perlmutter</a> If you wish to have further information about LCSM, please contact Jeff Bonzelaar, Executive Director, at (313) 531-0111 or email: <a href="mailto:lifechallengesemi@earthlink.net">Life Changes MI.</a> Life Challenge's address is 17667 Pierson, Detroit, MI 48219.</p>

						<p>A letter acknowledging your donation will be sent to you for tax purposes. If you want further documentation please let Laura Perlmutter or Dave Shelton know. Please send your donations to us at D/A Central, Inc.</p>

							<h5>The Crim</h5>
							<p>Former Speaker of the House, Bobby Crim, created The Crim Road Race in 1977, to contribute something to the athletes of Michigan Special Olympics. Bobby began organizing this small road race in his home community to establish three main goals. First, to run a world-class road race in the city of Flint, Michigan, secondly, to raise charitable dollars for mentally handicapped athletes, and finally, to foster community pride and cooperation among the residents of the greater Flint area.</p>

							<p>The Crim has made tremendous progress throughout the years. In 1985, local citizens agreed that the Crim deserved a solid commitment from the community and developed a Board of Directors, in addition to incorporating as a 501 (c) (3). The main goal of helping one charity, Michigan Special Olympics, expanded into assisting five others as well which consist of; Big Brother/Big Sisters of Greater Flint, Fair Winds Girl Scouts, Shelter of Flint, Genesee County Literacy Coalition and the Crim Youth Development Program.</p>

							<p>As time ticked on and the race numbers grew, so did the race options. Other distances soon joined the original 10-Mile Race. In 1987, the 8K Race, was added and in 1988, the 5K Family Walk and Teddy Bear Trot became a part of the Crim tradition. With the new decade, the Crim 8K Walk, Friday's evening concert, carnival rides as well as Saturday entertainment was added to the line up.</p>

							<p>Since the Bobby Crim Road Race was progressing and expanding, the name was changed to represent the vast weekend of events that it had become. In 1992, the name Crim Festival of Races was born and the event still continued to grow. Since that time, the Crim added the 1-Mile Run, 8K Racewalk, 5K Run, Competitive Walk, Neighborhood Running Clubs, Crim Kids Classic, the Crim Training Program, Beyond 2000 Program (community fitness program) and The Feelin' Good Mileage Club (school fitness program).</p>

							<p>Throughout its growth, the original visions of the Crim have not been lost or compromised. The Crim Festival of Races is ranked as one of the top world-class races in its league, currently helps to raise money for six local charities and has developed an incredible amount of community support. From volunteers to participants to spectators, Crim pride is visible across thousands of faces during the fourth weekend of August- year after year.</p>

						<h5>The Brooksie Way</h5>
						<p>County Executive L. Brooks Patterson launched The Brooksie Way Half Marathon and 5K Race/Walk to enhance the quality of life for residents of Oakland County by promoting healthy, active lifestyles.</p>

						<p>The Brooksie Way joins <a href="http://www.countyoursteps.com/Pages/default.aspx", target="_blank">"Count Your Steps,"</a> a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that encourages children and adults to engage in more physical exercise through fun activities. Proceeds from the event are reinvested to support fitness activities in Oakland County. Funds will be used for health related programs/activities like the Oakland County Count Your Steps Program.</p>

						<p>The Brooksie Way is not merely a road race through inviting Oakland County neighborhoods, a vibrant university campus or a lush trail system. It's a model for life, a model for living. Dream big. Dream often and follow your dreams. But most importantly, do it now and do it all the way.</p>
