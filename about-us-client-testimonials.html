						<h5>Industry: Health Care / Pharmaceutical / Hospital</h5>
						<blockquote>"The fully integrated Lenel security system you set up for us has been the most reliable, efficient and flexible system I've worked with.  I know a lot of that reliability had to do with your team of security experts. Their fine-tuning and anticipation of what we needed to do next, in our ever-changing facility, created a smooth and uninterrupted security system.<br/><br/>

						Because of what you and your team set up here, we were able to reduce security manpower with no decrease in the quality of our security coverage.  When you realize that we are a 2.4 million square foot facility with 4500+ active access badges; occupying 26 buildings, seven off site locations and about two hundred acres of land, that is a most remarkable accomplishment.<br/><br/>

						Thank you again for the use of your expertise and all your hard work.<br/><br/>

						Regards."</blockquote>
						
						<b>H.B.  Director of Security</b>
						
						<div class="line"></div>
						
						<blockquote>"While we are still compiling data to gauge our savings, it is apparent D/A Central, Inc. has made a difference to our bottom-line savings.  Prior to installation some of our cashiers had an abundance of mistakes and over rings, making it difficult for the food service manager to track cash flow.  Since installation, our food service manager has been so pleased that we have now had D/A Central install a register information system in our coffee shop.<br/><br/>

						I have found D/A Central and all their representatives to be trustworthy and honest.  They are always helpful in pointing out ways that we can do our job more effectively and ways that we can save money.  I give D/A Central my highest recommendation.<br/><br/>

						Thank you."</blockquote>
						
						<b>T.D. Security Manager</b>
						
						<div class="line"></div>
						
						<blockquote>"I would like to thank you on behalf of the Security Department and all the officers involved in your excellent training presentation. Because  you took the time out to assist others, each Officer will receive their certification in the 7 month course which had a total of 32 speakers. Thereby the officers each received a total of 42 Credit Hours.<br/><br/>
						
						A thank you from the International Hospital of Safety and Security Association.<br/><br/>

						Sincerely."</blockquote>

						<b>C.R.  Security Investigator</b>
						
						<div class="line"></div>
						
						<blockquote>"I want to give your tech a pat on the back from Pfizer Security. Our tech office agrees with our security's assessment
						of your tech and company's work ethics.. The work completed obviously shows D/A Central had Pfizer's needs in mind."</blockquote>

					<h5>Industry: Financial Institution</h5>
				
					<blockquote>"I just wanted to say thank you for the terrific representation you have for your company on this side of the state.  Your sales person and company keep our service top notch.<br/><br/>

					Recently your company installed D/A cameras at our Westnedge office in Kalamazoo.  Our bank manager reported to me that she is VERY pleased with the D/A cameras, and that the installer was very professional, hard working, and pleasant to work with.  I've felt that way for years but it's always nice to have our customers concur.<br/><br/>

					Thank you for the on-going excellent service.  I appreciate it."</blockquote>

					<b>C.K.M.  Security Investigator</b>
					<div class="line"></div>
				
					<blockquote>"I just wanted to take a minute to send you a Thank You for the great customer service your company provides!  I needed       35mm security film and placed the order.  Promptly, I was emailed that we would receive the film immediately.  We were really low and needed the film quickly.  Your tech drove all the way to our branch in Trenton so that we could have the film in a timely manner.<br/><br/>

					Your staff goes out of their way to make sure we had what we needed a timely manner and we greatly appreciate your customer service.  We appreciate what you did for your branch.<br/><br/>

					Thanks again."</blockquote>

					<b>M.B.  Director of Security</b>
					<div class="line"></div>
				
					<blockquote>"I wanted to write you to let you know what a great job your team has done for us in the out state area this past year. We've had wonderful pictures processed by your lab technicians that the police are using for evidence in the trials of two separate robberies!  They've opted to use the 35mm pictures over the video (in cases where we have both) due to the clarity.<br/><br/>  In one such case we identified robbers in the Grand Rapids area that had been robbing in the SE area for several years.  We tied them to the SE robberies through your photos.  In other robbed branches the police have asked it we have the 35mm cameras in addition to the video surveillance but unfortunately we didn't have both coverage at all offices.  However, the fact that they ask for those is a tribute to the fine work by your tech's maintaining the cameras and the lab technicians that develop the film and keep them pack properly.<br/><br/>

					I just wanted to take the time to say THANK YOU to you and the D/A team.  You make our jobs easier and we appreciate you, keep up the good work."</blockquote>

The quality of the work performed was excellent and was completed without any disruption to business.  I was particularly impressed by the attention to detail in craftsmanship that is often lacking in today’s construction industry.  Your personnel was able to establish a good working relationship with our staff and made every effort to meet our security needs.  During the course of the projects D/A Central had the right solutions to our security design needs. Your staff was very responsive to helping us resolve issues and played a key role in helping us to remain on schedule and within budget.

						Your company previously installed a 16 camera CCTV system and the work done was outstanding. Just recently, D/A Central, Inc. expanded our system, adding and integrating over 70 more cameras. Once again your company went beyond our expectations.  The work was completed quickly, professionally and the technicians were of the highest quality.  Service after the sale has been superior and met with quick and efficient responses.<br/><br/>

						Both systems have preformed well for us and have proven to be a vital tool in protecting our city’s assets.<br/><br/>
